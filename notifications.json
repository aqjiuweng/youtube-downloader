There's a new notification system I (the developer) can use to communicate with you, for example, for urgent updates. The custom downloader is currently unavaiable due to a rewrite, since the old one was pretty much bare bones and totally not user friendly. Enjoy, and if you want, leave a star on the GitHub repository :)",
